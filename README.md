# CEH-Style Cost & Risk Model (Quickstart, PDR-Calibrated)

This is a lightweight parametric + probabilistic model aligned with the **NASA CEH 4.0** process:
- encode **CERs** by subsystem
- compute deterministic **P50** costs
- run **Monte Carlo** for **P10/P50/P90**
- run **Â±5% sensitivity** on key drivers

> Coefficients here are illustrative. Replace CER settings as you calibrate to your actual CERs.
